Handle Exceptions at the Appropriate Level: Handle exceptions at the level where you can provide meaningful error messages and take appropriate actions. If you can't handle an exception at a lower level, let it propagate up to a higher level where it can be dealt with effectively.


Raising an exception is appropriate when the absence of the desired value is considered an exceptional and unexpected condition.

This approach can help you identify and address issues early in the development process, making it easier to debug and fix problems.


The choice between returning None and raising an exception depends on the context of your program. If a non-200 status code in an HTTP request is something you can gracefully handle as a valid response (e.g., logging the error and continuing execution), then returning None might be sufficient. However, if it's a critical condition and you want to enforce strict error handling, raising an exception would be a better choice.
